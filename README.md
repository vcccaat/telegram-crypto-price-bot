# Features
* Get the latest crypto price on Binance via websocket 
* Apply webhook to listen requests with the update data from telegram, instead of using polling to check for updates every few seconds
* Embed inline callback buttons to make easy bot-user interation with a simple click
* Promisify redis to avoid nested callbacks and make it easier to get the result return from the callback


# How to run
This project requires API keys from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management) and [Telegram](https://t.me/botfather). 

If you only need  crypto price feed instead of using spot/margin/future trading service of a Binance account, Binance API key is optional. Once you put the API keys in `.env`, install the project dependencies and start the project by following the steps below:
